			<h3>Text mashup exercise by Ruta Kruliauskaite</h3>
		</div> <br><br>
		<div id="instructions">
			<p>When I was little, me, my mom and my sister had a "secret" language which we would speak when we didn't want anyone to understand it. We would add a "ver" prefix in front of every word and speak it so fast that sometimes we even we would get lost with it.
			The below exercise is a simple example of how it might work in a written form.
			As an example paragraph I have chosen a short extract from my favorite theatre script "The Pillowman" by Irish playwright, screenwriter and film director Martin McDonagh.

			As the first step, excercise asks you to paste in your paragraph into the input field and click submit.</p>
		</div> <br>

			<textarea id="input" type="text" placeholder="My paragraph is: Once upon a time in a tiny cobble-streeted town on the banks of a fast-flowing river, there lived a little boy who did not get along with the other children of the town; they picked on and bullied him because he was poor and his parents were drunkards and his clothes were rags and he walked around barefoot."></textarea>

			<input id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit!"> <br>

		<div id="following">
			<p id="almost">Once you do that the written algorithm runs through the code, adds "ver" prefix to each of the words and displays the text in a "secret" language:</p> <br>
